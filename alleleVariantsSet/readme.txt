# Content and Rationale
The current folder holds collections of "allelic variants" that can be used, in conjuction with "augmentClusters.pl" tool in HaploCoV to search for novel potential groups of genomic sequences/lineages in a classification system such as Pango and/or HaploCoV itself.
These collections can be broadly categorized into 3 main categories
1. Highly variable genomes -> allelic variants found in at least 25 "highly divergent" genomic sequences, at different intervals of time.  Highly divergent/variable genome are defined as those carrying at least 6 or more allele variants that are not characteristic to the lineage to which they belong. Intervals of time were defined as non-overlapping windows of 60 days, starting from Mon 12-30-2019 and are expressed in "HaploCoV format", i.e offsets from the start date. These files are stored under the folder: HighVar
2. Country specific allele variants -> allele variants reaching a high frequeny of 1% or higher, for at least 15 days in any country. Each country corresponds to a file. These files are stored under the folder: country. Each file is named after the country from which it was derived. These files are updated every 15 days.
3 Increased frequency alleles: allelic variants showing an increase in their prevalence in the global viral population of a 2 fold or more in the last 30 days. Intervals of time were defined starting from Mon 12-30-2019 and are expressed as offset.  These files are stored under the folder: HighFreq
