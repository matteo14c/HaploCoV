Perl and mummer
===============

HaploCoV is written in the Perl programming language. Hence you will need Perl to run it. Perl should be already installed by default on any unix and Mac OSX system. 
Please follow this `link <https://www.perl.org/get.html>`_ for instructions on how to install Perl 

Please follow this `link <https://sourceforge.net/projects/mummer/files/>`_ for detailed instruction on how to install and run Mummer instead. 
A detailed manual can also be found in the main documentation of CorGAT at  `readthedocs <https://corgat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prerequisites.html>`_.
