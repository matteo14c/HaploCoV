Configuration files
===================

HaploCoV requires a set of configuration files. Tools/utility will quit and halt their execution if these configuration files are not found . All configuration files need to be in the **same folder** from where the utilities are executed.
These files include:

1. *globalAnnot*: a file with functional annotation of the complete collection of SARS-CoV-2 variants. This file can be generated by using CorGAT (see Chiara et al 2020), for your convenience, and up to date copy is  included in the this repository. The file is updated on a weekly basis (every Wednesday).  The most recent copy is automatically downloaded by LinToFeats.pl at every execution. 

2. *areaFile*: This configuration file defines macro-geographic areas as described in *Chiara et al 2022*. The file can be edited (see Execution of custom analyses) to specify user defined macro-geographic regions.  

3. *linDefMut*: contains defining mutations for every Pango Lineage. Updated on a weekly basis (every Wednesday). 

While all the tools in HaploCoV that use these files will attempt to download the most recent version directly from this github repository, users are kindly asked to *double check* that all the configuration files are in place before executing their analyses.
